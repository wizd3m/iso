# rareOS ISO production

This repository contains the tools necessary for building rareOS ISOs.

## Building

The build is controlled by the Makefile. The following commands can be used:
- `make` - Build an ISO at `build/17.10/rareos.iso`
- `make qemu_bios` - Run the ISO in BIOS mode
- `make qemu_uefi` - Run the ISO in UEFI mode
- `make clean` - Remove the build files, keeping the debootstrap
- `make distclean` - Remove the debootstrap and other build files

The configuration can be changed in `mk/config.mk`. 

To rebuild the ISO when you have made changes, you can use `make clean && make`
